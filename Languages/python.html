        <p>Python is a language for high-level programming designed to be easy to read and easy to implement. It is open source, meaning it can be used free of charge, except for commercial applications. Python can run on Mac, Windows, and Unix systems and has been ported to virtual machines in Java and .NET as well.</p>
        <p>Python, like Ruby or Perl, is considered a scripting language and is mostly used for Web applications and dynamic Web content development. A variety of 2D and 3D imaging applications also support it, allowing users to build custom plug-ins and extensions with Python. GIMP, Inkscape, Blender, and Autodesk Maya provide examples of applications that support a Python API.</p>
        <p>It is possible to parse(which means to analyze an object) and run scripts written in Python (.PY files) immediately. They can also be stored as compiled programs (.PYC files), which are also used to reference other Python programs as programming modules.</p>
