        <p>JavaScript is commonly used in web development as a programming language. Netscape built it as a way of introducing dynamic and interactive elements to websites. </p>
        <p>JavaScript is a scripting language on the client side, meaning that the source code is interpreted rather than on the web server by the client's web browser. This ensures that JavaScript functions can be run without interacting with the server after a webpage has been loaded.For example, a JavaScript function can review a web form before it is submitted to make sure all the necessary fields have been filled out.The JavaScript code will generate an error message before any information is actually transmitted to the server.</p>
        <p>JavaScript code can be embedded anywhere inside the HTML of a website, much like server-side scripting languages like PHP and ASP. However, only server-side code output is shown in HTML, while JavaScript code remains completely visible in the webpage source. It can also be referenced in a separate .JS file that can be displayed in a browser as well.</p>
        <p>It is possible to call JavaScript functions within "script" tags or when particular events take place. OnClick, onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onKeyDown, onKeyUp, onFocus, onBlur, onSubmit, and many more are instances. Although standard JavaScript is still used to perform simple client-side functions, JavaScript libraries including jQuery are now preferred to be used by many web developers to introduce more complex dynamic elements to websites.</p>
