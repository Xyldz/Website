        <p>Lua is a programming language widely used to extend software programs, or to add features. It uses basic C like syntax, allowing it to interact with a variety of other languages. Lua has a wide range of uses, but for web applications and video games, the most famous video games to use Lua are Garry's Mod and Roblox, you could even code your own games within the Roblox Editor</p>
        <p>While Lua is built to be simple and portable, it is a language that is also highly capable. A wide range of data types are provided by Lua, including strings, floating point numbers, and arrays. For conducting calculations, comparisons, and logic operations, it also requires several different operators. Functions, loops, and if-then statements are also provided by Lua. For automated memory management, the language also includes garbage collection.</p>
        <p>Since Lua is relatively lightweight, meaning it does not use more machine resources than needed, it is an ideal language for simple tasks to be performed. A programmer can, for example, code a C++ video game, but use Lua to control the characters and objects inside the game. Without the overhead other languages need, the simplicity of Lua will make it easier to code individual aspects of a program.</p>
